### Here are some of the references that I have used in creating these projects: 

### Password Generator - [Password Generator](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/create-a-random-password-generator-using-python-2fea485e9da9) , [AskPython](https://www.askpython.com/)

I used this article to build out the second version of my password generator. I followed the step-by-step tutorial and read up on how some of the modules work by reference the Python Docs as well. For the easy/hard version of my password generator I referenced an exercise that I did in my Python course.

### Rock, Paper, Scissors - [RPS game](https://thehelloworldprogram.com/python/python-game-rock-paper-scissors/) , [AskPython](https://www.askpython.com/)

I referenced this article to make my Rock, Paper, Scissors game, I followed the tutorials and also used the Python Docs to reference the use of random modules. I reviewed documentation on the how to use the random module and random functions reading the documentation on AskPython.com. 

### Star Wars Quiz - [Interactive Quiz Game](https://www.makeuseof.com/python-make-interactive-quiz-game/), [Using a VARIABLE to keep score in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec4ZnkaOjcM), [ASCII Art](https://asciiart.website/index.php?art=movies/star%20wars)

I used this article as a reference on how to build my Star Wars Quiz out and there are a few different ways that you can build out a quiz. I also briefly watched a Youtube tutorial on how to use a variable to create a score counter. I sourced the ASCII art in the code itself but decided to include it here as well. 

### GIFs - [GIPHY](https://giphy.com/)

I used this website for all of the fun GIFs that you see in this section and in the ReadMe section for the project as well.
