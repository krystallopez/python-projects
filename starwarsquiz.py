# Dev Notes:

# need to find a way to keep score in the game => This was completed.
# score counter would look like: score = 0, if the answer => This was completed.
# maybe create another variable for the decreased score so that the math is done properly by the program, like lost_point = score - 1
# Create a variable ifGameIsOn, set to true then if score is 0 switch to false
# create game over function, implement game over ideas, before if loop make sure to check if ifGameOn is true or false, if score is less than 0 isGameOn turns to false then game is over
