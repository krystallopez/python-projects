## Wireframe

- original idea was for an interactive Star Wars quiz
- Quiz will give a user a point every time they get the answer correct 
- Score counter would be implemented 
- Print message will appear each time the user gets an answer right or if they get it wrong as well 
- Build multiple mini games and apps and use different methods to create them 
- Create a read me describing what each project and what was used 
- Demonstrate use of core programming concepts 
- Don't overwork yourself! Do what you can, you are doing great!


## Stretch Goals

- Would like to have each item on a flash card layout 
- Find a way to deploy the games to a web application 
- Make it bit more dynamic with styling
